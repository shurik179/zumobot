# zumobot

This project is intended for students wishing to do robotics projects using Pololu's [Zumo32U4 robot](https://www.pololu.com/category/170/zumo-32u4-robot). Zumo is a great little robot, but the library provided by Pololu might be difficult to use for kids who have little programmign experience. This project contains library which provides several higher-level commands (such as `goForward(distance_in_mm)`  or `turn(number_of_degrees)`), making it easier for beginners. In addition we provide a user guide leading the user through installation, configuration and several simple projects, from following the line to sumo bot competition to finding your way out of the maze. 

This project was written by Alexander Kirillov for use at [SigmaCamp](http://sigmacamp.org). You can see some photos and videos from students using a previous version of this project at [sigmacamp.org/2015/semilabs/robotics](http://sigmacamp.org/2015/semilabs/robotics)
